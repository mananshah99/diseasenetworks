Disease spread, both locally and across continents, has been studied in various medical contexts; however, the problem has yet to be thoroughly analyzed from an informatics standpoint. In this work, we plan to incorporate the vast array of big data presently available--specifically tweets on the social media site Twitter--in an attempt to model and predict disease genesis and dispersion over time. We further work towards generating cohesive equation-based models in the hope of comparing the results obtained from social media with both CDC ILI distributions and simulation curves.
